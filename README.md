# PDG3

# This experiment was designed to assess the psychophysical properties of probability judgments. The basic design is straightforward but you will need to install <a href="https://psiturk.org/">Psiturk</a> to run the code. If you want the images I used for the experiment you can find them on the osf: <a href="https://osf.io/adms6/">my OSF page</a> or, if you have <a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a> you can use the automation script in my <a href="https://github.com/ogradyso/MarblesGame_ImageMaker">MarblesGame_ImageMaker repo</a>.
